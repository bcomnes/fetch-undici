## Releasing

Changelog, and releasing is autmated with npm scripts and actions.  To create a release:

- Navigate to the actions tab
- Select the `npm bump` action.
- Trigger an action, specifying the semantic version bump that is needed.
- Changelog, Github release and npm publish is hanlded by the action.
- An in depth review of this system is documented here: [bret.io/projects/package-automation](https://bret.io/projects/package-automation/)

If for some reason that isn't workoing or a local release is preferred, follow these steps:

- Ensure a clean working git workspace.
- Run `npm version {patch,minor,major}`.
  - This wills update the version number and generate the changelog.
- Run `npm publish`.
  - This will push your local git branch and tags to the default remote, perform a [gh-release](https://ghub.io/gh-release), and create an npm publication
